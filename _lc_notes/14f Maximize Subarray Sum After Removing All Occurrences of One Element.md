title: Maximize Subarray Sum After Removing All Occurrences of One Element
---

## Maximize Subarray Sum After Removing All Occurrences of One Element [LC#3410]
> You are given an integer array nums. You can do the following operation on the array at most once:
> - Choose any integer x such that nums remains non-empty on removing all occurrences of x. 
> - Remove all occurrences of x from the array.

Return the maximum subarray sum across all possible resulting arrays.

### Intuition

### Code
```python

```

### Time complexity
- $T(n) = $ 
- $S(n) = $
