```
  [ f ][ f ][ f ][ t ][ t ][ t ][ t ][ t ]     
                   └── ans 
```

```python
def binary_search(search_space) -> int:
    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space)
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if condition(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```
